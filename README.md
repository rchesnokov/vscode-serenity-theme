# Serenity theme

### Built for VSCode with love <3

I always found most of present themes either ugly or very eye-straining.

So i've built my own one with 3 things in mind:

- it should be easy on eyes for all-day (or all-night :) coding
- yet it should be colorful and pleasant for an eye
- should have good syntax highlight with clear distinction of important keywords

Please keep in mind that i'm a frontend deveoper and this theme is mainly intended to be used by web devs since i didn't test it on any server-side languages.
