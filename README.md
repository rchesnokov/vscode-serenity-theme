## About

I always found most of present themes either ugly or very eye-straining.

So i've built my own one with 3 things in mind:

- it should be easy on eyes for all-day (or all-night :) coding
- yet it should be colorful and pleasant for an eye
- it should have good syntax highlight with clear distinction of important keywords

Please keep in mind that i'm a frontend developer and this theme is mainly intended to be used by web devs since i didn't test nor optimize it for any server-side languages.

_I hope you enjoy it!_

## Contribution

If something is wrong or ugly in some language feel free to create an issue or pull request in [Repository](https://github.com/rchesnokov/vscode-serenity-theme). Don't forget to provide code sample for your language so i can test the highlight.
