## About

I've built this theme with 3 things in mind:

- it should be easy on eyes for all-day (or all-night :) coding
- yet it should be colorful and pleasant for an eye
- it should have good syntax highlight with clear distinction of important keywords

Please keep in mind that i'm a frontend developer and this theme is mainly intended to be used by web devs since i didn't test nor optimize it for any server-side languages.

_I hope you enjoy it!_

## Contribution
